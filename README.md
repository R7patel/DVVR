# DVVR [Work In Progress]
Data Visualization using Virtual Reality (extending DECK.GL)

By leveraging the power of deck.gl visualization tool, we want to view complex datasets in stereoscopic view in a virtual environment.

## VR Capability
This example can be viewed in VR-capable devices. 
It uses deck.gl's multi-viewport, the WebVR API and [WebVR Polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill) library.
### Working
The `_initVRDisplay()` method setups the `VRDisplay` and sets `vrEnabled` to true if a VR display is connected.

In the absence of an actual VR device, the default Orbit Controller along with the Orbit Viewport will be used.
However, a stereoscopic view can still be activated.

### Rendering Viewports
For stereoscopic rendering and Side-by-Side display, two default viewports are used.

The WebVR API provides [`VRFrameData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRFrameData) constructed by the `VRDisplay.getFrameData` function. This frame data is essential for obtaining the `viewMatrix` and `projectionMatrix` of both the left and right eye.
The base deck.gl viewport can directly accept these matrices using the `DeckGL.viewports` property.

### Emulated VR Display
The ```EmulatedVRDisplay``` comes into picture when an actual VR hardware is not present.
It provides a mock `VRFrameData` object which contains necessary matrices used for rendering the viewports.

The `getFrameDataFromPose()` method accepts an emulated [`VRPose`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRPose) object which contains the orientation and position. 
Thus, allowing manual control over the pose and finally, interaction in the viewports.
